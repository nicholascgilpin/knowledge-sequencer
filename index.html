              Knowledge Map is a website designed to help you learn any skill as
              fast as possible. Use the search box to select an interesting
              skill. After selecting a skill, the knowledge map will show you
              a list of prerequisites for that skill. Choose the first
              prerequisite you don't know about to start learning. You can use
              the next/back buttons to navigate between lessons.
              Knowledge graph simplifies learning by only giving you the
              knowledge you need to learn the specific knowledge that you seek.
